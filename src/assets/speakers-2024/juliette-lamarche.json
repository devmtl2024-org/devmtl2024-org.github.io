  "bio": "I am a fullstack developer with a formal training in mathematics and linguistics. I also write poetry. I love functional programming, which I try to make palatable to non FP programmers. As a former analyst, I am sensitive to business perspectives, making sure technical solutions are also creating business value. Finally, poetry and linguistics are giving me insights on what makes a code easier to understand.",

  "title": "Finite state machines: sometimes a library, always a pattern",
  "description": "Finite state machine is a formalism which helps model an application logic in a way that is expressive of domain knowledge. xState has popularized the concept in the JavaScript ecosystem. Taking a little distance from the famous library, we will revisit the foundations and see how we can apply the pattern, taking inspiration from functional programming. We will see how state machines solve common programming problems with maintainable code.",
